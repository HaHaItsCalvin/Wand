Instructions for naming directories.
Formatting is as follows: 
#~/Wand/motion/Motion_data/peaks/sorted
#~/Wand/motion/Xcorr_data/peaks/sorted

Note about BubbleSort.c:
#use correct bubble sort.c in the main Wand directory for all sorting;
#any other version of bubble sort.c won't be correct; it's not set up
#to normalize the waveforms in the same scaling method


Patronus Directory Status:
#Sort Peaks for Motion Data
#Find peaks & sort for Xcorr

Disarm Directory Status:
#Disarm 1 & 2 have issues with their sorted peaks... get -nan messing it up
#Disarm 3-8 don't have the issue with -nan... peculiar tbh

Aquamente Directory Status:
#Sort Peaks for Motion Data

FANN Training for Disarm & Patronus:
#Must determine suitable features for motion recognition...
